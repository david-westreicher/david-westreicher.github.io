[Alcazar]() is a new pen and paper puzzle game created by [gerard]().
I first heard about Alcazar when [Jonathan Blow]() posted about his achievements in the game:

On the game's website you can try out some example games.
The goal of the game is to draw a single path through the maze that visits every cell of the gamefield.

I tried to solve the 4th puzzle, but after 15 minutes I was thinking about how I could implement a solver for the game.
I closed the tab on my browser and opened up [vim]() and the coding began.


First up was the representation of the game in a 2-dimensional array.

<div style="float:left">
{% highlight java %}
x x x x x x x
x 0   0   0 x
x   x x x   x
  0 x 0   0 x
x   x   x   x
  0 x 0   0 x
x   x x x   x
x 0   0   0 x
x x x x x x x
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
