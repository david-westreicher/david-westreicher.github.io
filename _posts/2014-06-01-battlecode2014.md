[Battlecode](http://www.battlecode.org) is a worldwide programming contest organized at the [MIT](http://mit.edu).
> The 6.370 Battlecode programming competition is a unique challenge that combines battle strategy, software engineering and artificial intelligence. In short, the objective is to write the best player program for the computer game Battlecode.

In the contest a 2-player game written in Java is given. Each contestant has to write an [AI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) for one of the players. After 3 weeks a preliminary tournament is held, where you can qualify for the finals, which is held in front of a live audience, commentated by the organizers.

In 2013 I came across Battlecode, but it was too late for participating in the tournament.
One year later me and a [friend of mine](https://www.github.com/juanolon) entered the tournament with the very Austrian name "[schnitzel](https://github.com/david-westreicher/schnitzel)".

## 2014 Specifications
In the game of 2014 you could win by [sending more GigaGallons milk to space than your opponent](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-server/blob/2014-1.3.3/specs.md).
The gamefield is discretized into a grid, where every \\(cell_i\\) in the grid contains \\(c_i\\) cows.
A \\(cell_i\\) can only be traversable if it isn't water and there is no other robottype on this cell.

* All teams started out with a fixed positioned HQ <img style="display:inline;height:1rem;vertical-align:top" src="/static/2014-06-01-battlecode/hq1.png"/> that could spawn
* SOLDIERS <img style="display: inline;vertical-align:top;height:1rem" src="/static/2014-06-01-battlecode/soldier1.png"/> (aka space cowboys). Each of these soldiers could move (orthogonally and diagonally), shoot, suicide or transform into a 
* PASTR <img style="display: inline;vertical-align:top;height:1rem" src="/static/2014-06-01-battlecode/pastr1.png"/> or NOISE TOWER <img style="display: inline;vertical-align:top;height:1rem" src="/static/2014-06-01-battlecode/noisetower1.png"/>

A PASTR was the essential building which sends milk generated from nearby cows into space.
A special mechanic of this year's game was that the cows where sensitive to noise.
If a soldier shoots or runs it generates noise and nearby cows run away from the noise source.
This allowed some basic herding of cows, by generating noise in a smart pattern.

Green squares represent the number of cows on this cell (the bigger/darker the square, the more cows live there). The cells can be green, grey or blue (grass, road or water). In this example, red has one HQ, five soldiers of which one is shooting and one is transforming into one of the buildings and a PASTR." imagesize="80" %}
Some more details of the game:

* each robot can't share information to the other robots. The only way to communicate is a radio (```int[]```) where we can store one ```int``` per channel
* the execution of the robots actions is turn based
* you have 2000 [bytecodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) per round per robot. If you need more bytecodes, your execution is split into several turns and you gain "action delay". Action delay slows down your ability to spawn, move, shoot or transform. These constraints boil down that the player who uses less bytecodes (efficient code) wins the battles.
