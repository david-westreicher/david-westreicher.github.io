Hi, this is my first post detailing how i created this site.
I was looking for a simple static site that was easy to handle and required a free hosting plan.
After some time I found out that you were able to host websites on github, which was perfect, because I already had some projects on github.

You can create a new repository named "username.github.io" and just push your "index.html" to the root of your repository and you are done.
My repository is [here](https://github.com/david-westreicher/david-westreicher.github.io).
The cool thing is that these github pages can use [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll): 

 > Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites.
 
It just boils down to creating *.md files (the same [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files used for the README.md) for every blog post/site. This post for example can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david-westreicher/david-westreicher.github.io/master/_posts/2014-05-25-hi.md).

I used [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) for the starting point of this [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) site.

### Summary

* Signup for github
* create a repository named username.github.io

```
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
git clone https://github.com/poole/hyde
mv hyde/* username.github.io
cd username.github.io
git add -A
git commit -m "my website"
git push origin master
```
* wait 10 minutes
* visit https://username.github.io
