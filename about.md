Hi, i'm a computer science student currently enrolled in the master course at the [University of Innsbruck](http://www.uibk.ac.at/). 
I'm interested in computer graphics, computer vision, machine learning and logics. 
My bachelor thesis was about finding solutions for the the pen and paper game [Slitherlink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink) with [SAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) solving.
I also worked 1 year for the Innsbruck startup [mohemian](http://mohemian.com/) writing Android apps:
